# Advanced

[## 📄️ LocalStorage

Local storage is a mechanism to store data in the browser. It allows the game to save data locally.](/docs/advanced/localstorage)

[## 📄️ Advanced Component Management

Components are the most useful and flexible objects in Messenger. They can be very powerful if used in a correct way.](/docs/advanced/comp)

[## 📄️ Initial Asset Loading Scene

You may want to use the asset loading GC instead. It automatically handles the asset loading scene for you.](/docs/advanced/assetload)

[## 📄️ Global Component

Although portable components and user components can be used to handle some logic, they are scene-specific, i.e. they cannot run across multiple scenes.](/docs/advanced/gc)

[## 📄️ Virtual Scene Runner

This feature is provided in the messenger-extra package.](/docs/advanced/vsr)

[## 📄️ Dynamic Asset Loading

Experimental feature. Small games should load all game assets at the beginning of the game.](/docs/advanced/dynamic_asset)

[## 📄️ Portable Components

This feature is highly experimental. To use portable components, you need to add messenger-extra to your dependencies.](/docs/advanced/portable)
